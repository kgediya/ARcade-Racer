# ARcade Racer 🏎️🕶️

**ARcade Racer** is an augmented-reality RC car experience built for **Snap Spectacles AR**. It augments your physical RC car with a virtual character, places AR coins, obstacles, and collider planes around your space — turning your floor into a fully playable arcade platform.

---

## 🎮 Features

### 📱 Real Car Sync with AR (Mobile Controller Binding)
The virtual character is synced with your physical RC car using Spectacles' `MotionControllerModule`, paired with a **custom 3D-printed mobile mount** for phone alignment.

- Uses live 6DoF transform data from the mobile
- Updates position + rotation in real time
- **3D mount files** included for phone-on-car setup
- Slight drift expected — dead reckoning improves continuity

---

### 🔁 Dead Reckoning for Prediction & Smooth Follow
Even when tracking drops, the driver stays visually in sync via **dead reckoning**:

- Predicts current position using velocity from last known frame
- Smooth interpolation avoids jittery jumps
- 🔍 Can be improved with ML-based object detection (e.g., YOLO ), but accessibility/performance tradeoffs  may exist

---

### ✋ Pinch-Based Ground Spawning
Objects like coins and obstacles are spawned only on horizontal ground using **Spectacles Interaction Kit** and world hit testing.

![Pinch Spawn](./Preview%20Files/preview2.gif)

- Spawns on pinch gesture —  on ground 
- First pinch spawns collider plane (`index 2`) invisibly for gameplay
- Pinch-and-hold for 1 second toggles between object types

---



### 🧰 3D Printed Mobile Mount
Includes `.blend` and `.glb` versions of a 3D-printed mobile mount that securely attaches your phone to your RC car.

- Optimized for phone size and camera alignment with physical rc car body
- Designed to stabilize tracking & reduce drift

## ⚙️ Core Scripts

### 🎮 `mobileController.ts`

* Binds the AR driver to phone’s position & rotation
* Performs dead reckoning when tracking drops
* Uses linear prediction + slerp rotation
* Applies smooth damping for natural movement

### 🧱 `WorldQueryHitSpawner.ts`

* Uses world hit testing to find horizontal surfaces
* Spawns objects from `objectsToSpawn[]`
* First pinch = spawn collider + target object
* Long pinch (1s+) toggles between object types

### 🪙 `collisionLogic.js`

* Handles coin collision detection
* Activates on rigid body triggers
* Updates game state or visual feedback on pickup

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Lens Studio 5.x+
* Snap Spectacles (latest generation with 6DoF)
* Physical RC Car with mounted phone
* 3D-printed mount (provided)

---

## 🚧 Future Work

* 🔘 **BLE Button Integration**: Add support for external Bluetooth trigger to shoot virtual enemies.
* 📈 Improve tracking with ML-powered object detection (e.g. YOLO or MediaPipe).
* 🌐 Add multiplayer via WebRTC/SyncKit.
* 💥 Expand with particle trails, powerups, and environment FX.
